This project is a Streamlit-based visualization tool that analyzes system performance logs and converts them into meaningful insights.
By uploading a .jsonl log file (CPU, GPU, Memory, IO, Context Switches data), the application automatically generates multiple real-time charts and graphs, making performance monitoring and benchmarking easier than ever.
